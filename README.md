## System Overview
SyBA (**Sy**nonymous of **BA**cterial Genes) is a **tool** and **database** for **standardizing gene names in bacterial genomes**. It provides a consistent nomenclature for gene names, allowing researchers to accurately search for genes from bacteria that cause **human diseases**, improving **public health** research on **foodborne illnesses**.  

The **SyBA** database is constructed using gene symbols and gene products (proteins) present in **1,215,109 functional bacterial genomes**, based on the genera _Campylobacter_, _Clostridium_, _Escherichia_, _Listeria_, _Salmonella_, _Shigella_, _Staphylococcus_, and _Vibrio_.  

**SyBA** includes a **Python class** for standardizing gene names, which can automatically find and change different name variations into a standard form. The class also generates search commands for specific genes or papers in **GenBank** or **PubMedCentral** with different bacterial gene names.  

Additionally, **SyBA** provides a **web form** that is **easy-to-use** for **researchers** to **search for specific genes or papers** in **GenBank** or **PubMedCentral**.  

The **SyBA** repository, hosted on **GitHub** and **licensed under MIT**, is a **freely accessible** resource for the **scientific community**. It offers comprehensive analysis results of bacterial gene names. In addition, it includes thorough **guidelines and sample scripts** to **assist researchers in their work**.
